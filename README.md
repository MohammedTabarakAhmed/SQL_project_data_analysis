# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top‚Äëpaid and in‚Äëdemand skills‚Äîstreamlining others‚Äô work to find optimal jobs. üöÄ
Data hails from my [SQL course(https://lukebarousse.com/sql)]. It‚Äôs a good SQL course, check it out! üéì




# The question I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

- What are the top‚Äëpaying data analytics jobs? üí∞
- What skills are required for these top‚Äëpaying jobs? üõ†Ô∏è
- Which skills are most in demand for data analysts? üìä
- Which skills are associated with higher salaries? üìà
- What are the most optimal skills to learn? 


# üõ†Ô∏èTools I Used:
For my deep dive into the data job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and reach critical insights. üí°
- PostgreSQL: My go‚Äëto for database management and executing SQL queries. üêò
- Git (Version Control): Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
